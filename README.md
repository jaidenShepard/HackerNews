#Hacker News Exercise

Using the  Hacker News API Documentation  (https://github.com/HackerNews/API) write a program that will print the title of the top 30 hacker news stories and the top 10 commenter names of these stories with the total number of comments that they posted (only for these 30 stories).
The program has to parallelize requests and aggregate the results as efficiently as possible.

Bonus points to display in HTML using React (extra bonuses for using Redux).
